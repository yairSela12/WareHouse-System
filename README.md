Food Warehouse Management System

Description:
This project is a C++ simulation of a food warehouse management system designed to handle orders, assign volunteers, and manage deliveries in a war-torn country. The system initializes from a configuration file, manages different types of customers and volunteers, processes orders, and simulates the warehouse operations through various actions. The primary goal is to practice object-oriented programming and efficient memory management in C++.

Skills Required:

Programming Languages: C++
Concepts and Techniques: Object-oriented design, Rule of 5 (copy constructor, move constructor, copy assignment operator, move assignment operator, destructor), memory management, simulation modeling.
Tools and Libraries: Standard Template Library (STL) for data structures like vectors.
Development Practices: Compiling and linking on a Unix system, using Valgrind for memory leak detection, implementing abstract classes and polymorphism.
